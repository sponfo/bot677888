INSTALLATION GUIDE

Go to https://ngrok.com/, download and signup. Connect your account using your auth token. (It is important to create an account and connect it. If you do not do that your session will expire in 2 hrs and you will have to create a new session with a new webhook.)

Open ngrok and type 'ngrok http 6969'

Copy the url written after 'Forwarding' and before '->' (https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.io). This is the ngrok webhook url.

Fill in the config

Sellix:

Create a product named in this format: {Amount} Server Boosts [{Months} Months], example: 14 Server Boosts [3 Months]. This is important as the program will not detect the amount of boosts and for how many months the server needs to be boosted.
Set the maximum quantity to 1.
Add a custom field and name it whatever you want (this field should be set for taking the server invite link as an input) Set 'type' to 'Text'. Copy and paste that name in config.json, 'field_name_invite' field.
After creating all the products, head over to Developers > Webhooks.
Click on Add Webhooks Endpoint.
Type: Sellix, Webhook URL: {ngrok webhook url}/sellix, Event: Order > order:paid.
You are all done.
Sell.App:
